# pbb-drylab
dry lab methods used in the group

## Introduction 

All scripts are available in /grp/pbb/scripts. Additional tools can be found in /grp/pbb/tools. Each member is encouraged to have a folder in /grp/pbb/members to make scripts available to the group. Please make sure that no large files are shared through this group volumen, because the size is rather small. Dedicated project volumes should be used for the storage and exchange of larger files.
